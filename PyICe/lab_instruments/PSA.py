            TIP Making Gated FFT Measurements With Your PSA
            The process of making a spectrum measurement with FFTs is inherently a “gated”
            process, in that the spectrum is computed from a time record of short duration, much like
            a gate signal in swept-gated analysis.
            The duration of the time record is 1.83 divided by the RBW, within a tolerance of about
            3% for bandwidths up through 1 MHz. Therefore, unlike swept gated analysis, the
            duration of the analysis is fixed by the RBW, not by the gate signal. Because FFT analysis
            is inherently faster than swept analysis, the gated FFT measurements can have better
            frequency resolution (a narrower RBW) than would swept analysis for a given duration of
            the signal to be analyzed.
            FFT analysis in the PSA usually involves making autoranged measurements, and the time
            required to autorange the FFT can be both long and inconsistent. The PSA hardware
            automatically sets the ADC Ranging to Bypass when any trigger, except Free Run is
            selected.
            To make a gated FFT measurement, set the analyzer as follows.
            1. Press Auto Couple, FFT & Sweep to select ManuaL: FFT.
            2. Set the resolution bandwidth to 1.83 divided by the required analysis time, or higher,
            by pressing BW/Avg, Res BW.
            3. Set the trigger source to the desired trigger, by pressing Trig.
            4. Set the trigger delay to observe the signal starting at the required time relative to the
            trigger. Negative delays are possible, by pressing Trig, Trig Delay.
            Key Path: Auto Couple, FFT & Sweep
            Remote Command:
            Use [:SENSe]:SWEep:TYPE AUTO|FFT|SWEep
            See “FFT & Sweep” on page 56.
            Example: SWE:TYPE FFT
            2.2.2.5 FFTs/Span
            Displays and controls the number of FFT segments used to measure the entire Span. This key is
            unavailable (grayed out) unless Sweep Type has been set to FFT. If Sweep Type is set to Auto and FFTs
            are selected, FFTs/Span is still unavailable, and the number of FFTs automatically selected is shown. If
            Sweep Type is set to Manual:FFT, FFTs/Span becomes available. Press FFTs/Span and an integer can
            be entered. The analyzer will try to use the number entered, but it may need to use more due to hardware
            or software limitations.
            An FFT can only be performed over a limited span or segment (also known as the FFT width). Several
            FFT widths may need to be combined to measure the entire span. The “FFT Width” is
            (Span)/(FFTs/Span), and affects the ADC Dither function. (See Auto Couple).
            FFT measurements require that the signal level driving the A/D converter in the IF be small enough to
            avoid overloading, and that the gain that controls that signal level remain fixed during the measurement
            of an entire FFT segment. This constraint can allow higher dynamic ranges in swept mode in some cases,
            but increasing FFTs/Span can restore that dynamic range to FFT measurements, at the expense of losing
            some of the speed advantages of the FFT.
            For example, in pulsed-RF measurements such as radar, it is often possible to make high dynamic range
            measurements with signal levels approaching the compression threshold of the analyzer in swept spans
            (well over 0 dBm), while resolving the spectral components to levels below the maximum IF drive level
            (about –8 dBm at the input mixer). But FFT processing experiences overloads at the maximum IF drive
            level even if the RBW is small enough that no single spectral component exceeds the maximum IF drive
            level. If the user reduces the width of an FFT using the FFTs/Span function, an analog filter is placed
            before the ADC that is about 1.3 times as wide as the FFT segment width. This spreads out the pulsed RF
            in time and reduces the maximum signal level seen by the ADC. Therefore, the input attenuation can be
            reduced and the dynamic range increased without overloading the ADC.
            Further improvement in the dynamic range is possible by changing the ADC gain. In swept analysis in
            the PSA, the gain is normally autoranged such that it can track the signal power as the analyzer sweeps
            through CW-like signals. Since FFT processing cannot autorange the gain within the measurement of a
            single FFT segment, the autoranging advantage is lost for single FFT measurements. But if the segments
            are reduced in width by using more FFTs/Span, then individual FFT segments can use higher gains,
            improving the dynamic range.

            and FFT Analysis", literature number 5980-3081EN, available on-line:

        '''2.3.1 Res BW
            Enables you to select the 3.01 dB resolution bandwidth (RBW) of the analyzer in 10% steps from 1 Hz to 
            3 MHz, plus bandwidths of 4, 5, 6, or 8 MHz. If an unavailable bandwidth is entered with the numeric 
            keypad, the closest available bandwidth is selected.
            Sweep time is coupled to RBW. As the RBW changes, the sweep time (if set to Auto) is changed to 
            maintain amplitude calibration. 
            Video bandwidth (VBW) is coupled to RBW. As the resolution bandwidth changes, the video bandwidth 
            (if set to Auto) changes to maintain the ratio set by VBW/RBW.
            When Res BW is set to Auto, resolution bandwidth is autocoupled to span, except when using the 
            CISPR and MIL detectors (Quasi Peak, EMI Average EMI Peak and MIL Peak). For these detectors, 
            Auto RBW coupling is to the center frequency. The ratio of span to RBW is set by Span/RBW
            (described on page 74). The factory default for this ratio is approximately 106:1 when auto coupled. 
            When Res BW is set to Man, bandwidths are entered by the user, and these bandwidths are used 
            regardless of other analyzer settings.
            NOTE In zero span, the auto/manual function of this key is not applicable. When Res BW 
            (Auto) is selected in non-zero span, any changes to Res BW while in zero span will revert 
            to the Auto value when you return to non-zero span. When Res BW (Man) is selected in 
            non-zero span, any changes to Res BW while in zero span will be maintained when you 
            return to non-zero span.
            NOTE When the Quasi Peak or one of the EMI detectors are selected, the resolution bandwidths 
            available are restricted to the set defined in Table 2-2 on page 83. When the MIL Peak 
            detector is selected, the resolution bandwidths available are restricted to the set defined in 
            Table 2-4 on page 85.
            A # mark appears next to Res BW on the bottom of the analyzer display when it is not coupled. To 
            couple the resolution bandwidth, press Res BW (Auto) or Auto All.
            NOTE For applications that require 6 dB resolution bandwidths, it is possible to use an 
            equivalent 3 dB resolution bandwidth. Because the analyzer has Gaussian RBW, the 
            equivalent 6 dB bandwidth of any RBW filter can be determined using the following 
            formula: 6 dB RBW = 3 dB RBW x 1.414. For example, if a 6 dB RBW of 100 kHz is 
            required, the equivalent 3 dB RBW Filter would be 100 kHz/1.414 = 70.7 kHz. The 
            closest RBW filter for the analyzer that would be used is 68 kHz.'''

Enables you to change the analyzer post-detection filter from 1 Hz to 8 MHz in approximately 10% steps 
between 1 Hz and 3 MHz plus the bandwidths of 4, 5, 6, and 
8 MHz. In addition, a wide-open video filter bandwidth (VBW) may be chosen by selecting 50 MHz. 
Video BW (Auto) selects automatic coupling of the Video BW filter to the resolution bandwidth filter 
using the VBW/RBW ratio set by the VBW/RBW key.
NOTE Sweep Time is coupled to Video Bandwidth (VBW). As the VBW is changed, the sweep 
time (when set to Auto) is changed to maintain amplitude calibration. This occurs 
because of common hardware between the two circuits, even though the Video BW filter 
is not actually “in-circuit” when the detector is set to Average. Because the purpose of the 
average detector and the VBW filter are the same, either can be used to reduce the 
variance of the result.
Although the VBW filter is not “in-circuit” when using the average detector, the Video 
BW key can have an effect on (Auto) sweep time, and is not disabled. In this case, 
reducing the VBW setting increases the sweep time, which increases the averaging time, 
producing a lower-variance trace. 
However, when the EMI Average detector is selected, the Video BW is restricted to 1 Hz 
while the sweep time is set to Auto.
When using the average detector with either Sweep Time set to Man, or in zero span, the 
VBW setting has no effect and is disabled (grayed out).

2.3.3 VBW/RBW 
Selects the ratio between the video and resolution bandwidths in a 1, 3, 10 sequence. A Video bandwidth 
wider than the resolution bandwidth (VBW/RBW ratio > 1.000), provides the best peak measurements of 
signals such as wideband radar pulses. A VBW narrower than the RBW (VBW/RBW ratio < 1.000) 
reduces the variance of noise-like signals and makes spectral components close to the noise floor easier 
to view. The knob and step keys change the ratio in a 1, 3, 10 sequence. If the numbered keys are used, 
the VBW/RBW ratio will be rounded to the nearest 1, 3, or 10 response. Pressing Preset or selecting 
Auto Couple, Auto All sets the ratio to 1.000 X. When VBW/RBW (Auto) is selected, the ratio is 
determined as indicated in Table 2-1 on page 70'''

            keypad (not the knob or step keys). Increasing the average number further smooths the trace. To select 
            the type of averaging used, press BW/Avg, Avg/VBW Type.
            Averaging restarts when any of the following occurs:
            • a new average number is entered.
            • any measurement related parameter (for example, center frequency) is changed.
            • Restart is pressed.
            • Single Sweep is pressed.
            In single sweep, the specified number of averages is taken, then the sweep stops. In continuous sweep,

                NOTE When you select log-power averaging, the measurement results are the average of the 
                signal level in logarithmic units (decibels). When you select power average (RMS), all 
                measured results are converted into power units before averaging and filtering operations, 
                and converted back to decibels for displaying. Remember: there can be significant 
                differences between the average of the log of power and the log of the average power.
                The following are the averaging processes within a spectrum analyzer, all of which are affected by this 
                setting:
                • Trace averaging (see BW/Avg) averages signal amplitudes on a trace-to-trace basis.
                • Average detector (see Detector, Average) averages signal amplitudes during the time or frequency 
                interval represented by a particular measurement point.
                • Noise Marker (see Marker Noise) averages signal amplitudes across measurement points to reduce 
                variations for noisy signals.
                • VBW filtering adds video filtering which is a form of averaging of the video signal.
                When manual is selected, the type is shown on the left side of the display with a #. When auto is

        '''2.4.1 Detector
This menu allows you to select a specific type of detector, or choose Auto to let the instrument select the 
appropriate detector for a particular measurement.
When discussing detectors, it is important to understand the concept of a trace “bucket.” For every trace 
point displayed in swept and zero-span analysis, there is a finite time during which the data for that point 
is collected. The analyzer has the ability to look at all of the data collected during that time and present a 
single point of trace data based on the detector mode. We call the interval during which the data for that 
trace point is being collected, the “bucket.” The data is sampled rapidly enough within a “bucket” that it 
must be reduced in some fashion to yield a single data point for each bucket. There are a number of ways 
to do this and which way is used depends on the detector selected. Details on how each detector does this 
are presented below.
In FFT analysis, the bucket represents just a frequency interval. The detector in an FFT mode determines 
the relationship between the spectrum computed by the FFT and the single data point displayed for the 
bucket.
When the Detector choice is Auto, the detector selected depends on marker functions, trace functions, 
and the trace averaging function. 
See “Auto Rules For Detector Selection” on page 80 for information on the Auto detector selection.
When you manually select a detector (instead of selecting Auto), that detector is used regardless of other 
analyzer settings.
The detector choices are:
• Normal − displays the peak of CW-like signals and maximums and minimums of noise-like signals. 
• Average − displays the average of the signal within the bucket. The averaging method depends upon 
Avg Type selection (voltage, power or log scales).
• Peak − displays the maximum of the signal within the bucket.
• Sample − displays the instantaneous level of the signal at the center of the bucket represented by 
each display point.
• Negative Peak − displays the minimum of the signal within the bucket.
• Quasi Peak − a fast-rise, slow-fall detector used in making CISPR compliant EMI measurements.
• EMI Average − displays the instantaneous level of the signal at the center of the bucket, just like the 
sample detector. It also changes the auto coupling of VBW, RBW and Avg/VBW Type and the set of 
available RBWs. This detector is used in making CISPR-compliant measurements.
• EMI Peak − the same as the Peak detector but uses CISPR related bandwidths.
• MIL Peak − the same as the Peak detector but uses MIL related bandwidths.
Because they may not find the true peak of a spectral component, neither average nor sample detectors 
measure amplitudes of CW signals as accurately as peak or normal, but they do measure noise without 
the biases of peak detection.
The detector in use is indicated on the left side of the display, just below Reference level. The

            at the center of the display. Reads out the average noise level, normalized to a 1 Hz noise power 
            bandwidth, around the active marker. The noise marker averages 5% of the trace data values, centered on 
            the location of the marker.

            To guarantee accurate data for noise-like signals, a correction for equivalent noise bandwidth is made by 
            the analyzer. The Marker Noise function accuracy is best when the detector is set to Average or

            Allows you to add an offset value to the displayed reference level. The reference level is the absolute
            using the numeric keypad or programming commands. The knob and step keys are not active.
            Offsets are used when a gain or loss occurs between a device under test and the analyzer input. Thus, the
            signal level measured by the analyzer may be thought of as the level at the input of an external amplitude
            conversion device. Entering an offset does not affect the trace position or attenuation value, just the
            displayed value readouts such as reference level and marker amplitudes.
            The maximum reference level available is dependent on the reference level offset. That is, Ref Level −
            Ref Level Offset must be in the range −170 to +30 dBm.
            For example, the reference level value range can be initially set to values from −170 dBm to 30 dBm
            with no reference level offset. If the reference level is first set to −20 dBm, then the reference level offset
            can be set to values of −50 to +150 dB.
            If the reference level offset is first set to −30 dB, then the reference level can be set to values of −200
            dBm to 0 dBm. In this case, the reference level is “clamped” at 0 dBm because the maximum limit of
            +30 dBm is reached with a reference level setting of 0 dBm with an offset of −30 dB. If instead, the
            reference level offset is first set to 30 dB, then the reference level can be set to values of −140 to +60
            dBm.
            When a reference level offset is entered, the offset value appears on the left side of the display under
            Offst (as opposed to frequency offsets which appear at the bottom of the display.) To eliminate an
            offset, press Ref Lvl Offst, 0, and dB.'''

    # To guarantee accurate data for noise-like signals, a correction for equivalent noise bandwidth is made by 
    # the analyzer. The Marker Noise function accuracy is best when the detector is set to Average or 
    # Sample, because neither of these detectors will peak-bias the noise. The trade off between sweep time 
    # and variance of the result is best when Avg/VBW Type is set to Power Averaging. Auto coupling, 
    # therefore, normally chooses the Average detector and Power Averaging. Though the Marker Noise 
    # function works with all settings of detector and Avg/VBW Type, using the positive or negative peak 
    # detectors gives less accurate measurement results

    # average detector is selected. If the Avg/VBW type is set to Auto, Power Averaging is selected, other 
    # choices of detector and Avg/VBW type will usually cause measurement inaccuracy. The active marker 
    # pair indicate the edges of the band. Only Delta Pair and Span Pair marker control modes can be used 
    # while in this function, selecting any other mode (for example, Normal or Delta) turns off this function
