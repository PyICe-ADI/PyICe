Comparing ATE data, to bench recorded data.  This code will need to parse STDF
files, retrieve ATE tests by test name. This code will also need to compare
bench test data, to a particular STDF test name. Assume that the STDF going into
this code is the ATE test data of just a singular DUT. Data will also have to be
filtered by temperature.

        this class will take in an STDF and organize by temperature and testname
    Compare
        This will take in Bench data (of a single test) and compare it against
        ATE test data of the same test.
        No database - just a singular measurement.

Questions:
    1) Does the DUT ID come from a specific test in the STDF? I think so
        a) Its not a PTR, its a PIR (or something like that or PRR)
Comment: 
    1) Die traceability is not a set in stone thing - should be done on a per part basis 
    2) temperature is in the dlog - this data should be in the dlog (part of MIR)
    3) if there is no test name - look for last defined at that test number  (ususally at DUT 0)  
    4) Lets try to use units_parse (from pypi)
