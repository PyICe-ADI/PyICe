Comparing ATE data, to bench recorded data.  This code will need to parse STDF
files, retrieve ATE tests by test name. This code will also need to compare
bench test data, to a particular STDF test name. Assume that the STDF going into
this code is the ATE test data of just a singular DUT. Data will also have to be
filtered by temperature.

Classes:
    STDFParser
        this class will take in an STDF and organize by temperature and testname
    Compare
        This will take in Bench data (of a single test) and compare it against
        ATE test data of the same test.
        No database - just a singular measurement.
